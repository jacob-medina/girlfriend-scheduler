The aim of this project is to provide a themed planning experience to inspire fun and thoughtfullness in scheduling a day your partner.

Using Day.js, Girlfriend Scheduler automatically updates to the user's current date and time to inform them if activities are in the past, present, or future. When the user "Promises" to do an activity, it is saved to their local storage and persists between sessions.
